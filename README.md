### Hi there :wave:

I'm working on Azure SDK (Azure Monitor and Application Insights in the past) and contribute to OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions in messaging and HTTP areas. 

:books: Check out my [new book](https://a.co/d/2RJCjVS) on modern distributed tracing on .NET and OpenTelemetry or just play with [examples](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-Distributed-Tracing-in-.NET)! @ or :email: me what you think.
